This is a mod of the [BoomBox](https://github.com/ObliviousGmn/Printer-Mods/tree/main/BoomBox%20Filter) filter to add wagos to make wiring the 2 fans easier. 

To add wagos just pop wago 221 into the 2 slots at the top of the fan bay.

The only other change is the route for the wiring on the side has been removed and there is a hole from the bottom to run it. I thought it looked cleaner without the exterior cables.
